Meela-Windows-8-App
===================

This is a fully functional Windows 8 app which allows for shortening URLs using the Meela API (http://mee.la/). I plan to finish off and commercially release this app on the Windows Store at some point, but until then, I am making it open-source.

Improvements to be made (contributions very welcome):
- Snap view should be better suited to displaying the content at that window size
- Share target view should be better suited to displaying the content at that window size
- Graphics should be added/improved
